Place the wrapped turkey on a baking sheet and set on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Defrost for 1 day if fresh, or 4-5 days, if frozen. For a quicker defrost, submerge the turkey in a large sink or cooler filled with cold water and defrost for 30 minutes per pound of turkey.1 day before cooking, brine the turkey. Measure the salt into a small bowl. Set up your work station with kitchen shears, a plastic bag, a fresh baking sheet with a wire rack set over it, and a garbage can nearby.Cut the packaging off the defrosted turkey, being careful not to cut the skin or flesh, and remove from the bag. Set the turkey on the baking sheet with the wire rack. Cut off any excess skin around the neck and release the plastic holder securing the legs. Remove any innards and giblets from the cavity and discard. Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with paper towels.Sprinkle the salt all over the turkey, making sure to get in the cavity, under the skin, and between any crevices.Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for 1 day. If brining for more than 1 day, cover the turkey with plastic wrap, then remove for the last day to let the skin dry out before roasting.A few hours before serving, prepare the turkey for roasting. Set an oven rack at the lowest height and the other in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325˚F (160˚C).Add the butter to a medium bowl. Chop the sage leaves and add to the bowl, along with the garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Mash the herbs into the butter. Set aside.Set a roasting pan or single-use aluminum pan over a baking sheet near your work station.Trim off the wing tips of the turkey and add to the roasting pan. Cut off any excess skin to expose the wishbone, then use a paring knife to cut out the bone. Use your hands or kitchen shears if the bone is hard to remove. Add to the roasting pan.Turn the bird so the legs are facing you. Tug out the plastic holder. Loosen the skin around the breasts, using your fingers to create a pocket. Be careful not to tear the skin. Rub the herb butter under the skin, then all over the rest of the turkey. Make sure to get in any crevices and the cavity.Stuff the lemon wedges and ¼ of the onion inside the turkey cavity. Add the rest of the onion wedges to the roasting pan, along with the carrot and celery. Pour the chicken broth into the pan.Use the wire rack to rest the turkey over the roasting pan, then pour any accumulated juices from the baking sheet into the pan.Set the roasting pan on the lowest oven rack. Place the turkey on the wire rack on the middle oven rack, directly over the roasting pan to catch any juices.Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160˚F (71˚C). Start checking the turkey about 90 minutes into roasting to ensure it does not overcook.Remove the turkey from the oven and set the wire rack over a baking sheet to catch any juices. Let rest for about 30 minutes while the internal temperature climbs to 165˚F (74˚C).Meanwhile, make the gravy: Remove any solids from the roasting pan. Strain the liquid into a large pot and bring to a boil, then let reduce to your desired consistency. The gravy can be served as is or, for a thicker gravy, ladle a few spoonfuls of stock into a small bowl with the flour. Whisk until no lumps remain, then stir a bit of the flour mixture at a time back into the pot. Return to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes, until thickened. Repeat as needed until the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Reduce the heat to low, whisking occasionally, until ready to serve, or remove from the heat and bring back to temperature before serving.Carve the turkey: Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board with a lip to catch any juices. First, release the legs to make carving the rest of the bird easier. Using a sharp knife, cut along where the legs meets the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then, use your hands to pull the legs and thigh away from the carcass and tuck them under the wings to keep them in place.Cut straight down along both sides of the breast bone until you can’t cut any further, then cut horizontally near the wing to release the breasts from the carcass.Cut all the way through the legs to release from the hip joint.Find where the shoulder meets the breast, then cut through that joint to remove the wings, using your hands to pull the wing away if the joint is tough to find.Set the carcass aside--you can pick off any remaining meat for leftovers, or make stock from the whole carcass.Slice the breasts crosswise, against the grain, then transfer to a serving platter. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs through the joint, wiggling the knife to find an easy release or pulling apart with your hands. Add the drumsticks to the platter. Cut the thigh meat away from the bone, then into bite-size pieces, and add to the platter. Release the flats from the wings by cutting through the joint, pulling apart with your hands if necessary, then add to the platter.Rearrange the meat on the platter so the larger pieces of meat with crispy, browned skin are on top. Garnish the platter with sage leaves and lemon wedges, if desired.Serve with the warm gravy."

Transfer the browned meat to a plate as it finishes cooking and set aside.Add the carrots, onion, potatoes, remaining 5 cloves of minced garlic, and reserved spice mixture, Stir and cook until the vegetables brown slightly and start to soften, 15 minutes.Stir in the tomato paste and cook until aromatic, about 3 minutes.Add the crushed tomatoes and chicken broth. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer.Add the chicken, stir, and return to a simmer. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked through.Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons of yogurt, then cover and keep warm.Once the naan dough has risen, dump onto a floured surface, and divide into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ¼-inch (1 /2 cm) thick circle, approximately 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter.Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place a disc of naan dough in the skillet. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the dough puffs up, then flip and cook on the other side until browned, 1 minute. Transfer the naan to a medium bowl and place another bowl on top. Repeat with the rest of the naan dough, stacking bowls between each round. As the naan cools, they will retain the bowl shape.Brush the naan bowls with warm melted butter.Fill the naan bowls with the chicken curry and rice. Serve with yogurt, cilantro, and lime wedges."

Mix until there are no dry spots. Scrape down the sides of the container with a spatula. Cover with a lid.Use a rubber band or piece of tape to mark the mixture level. This will allow you to track any movement (eventually it will grow!) Set the starter in a warm spot. Let sit for 24 hours.Day 2: After 24 hours, open the container and look for signs of fermentation in the form of bubbles on top, volume growth, and/or a funky, slightly sweet acidic smell. If you see some of these signs, proceed to the next step. If not, cover the starter again and let sit for another 12–24 hours, until these signs appear. If the temperature in your house is cool, it may take a bit longer.Once the starter has gotten a bit bubbly and funky, it is time to discard and feed. Discard all but about 25 grams (2 tablespoons) of starter (see Note below on how to minimize waste!). Add another 100 grams warm water and stir to dissolve the remaining starter. Add 50 grams of bread flour and 50 grams of whole wheat flour and stir until there are no dry spots. Cover and let sit in a warm spot for another 24 hours.Days 3–15: Repeat the feeding process every day for 7–14 days. Eventually, a few hours after feeding, the starter will begin to grow, almost doubling in size, then deflate again. Once your starter is rising and falling regularly, it is in a good place.To test the readiness of the starter, do a float test: Fill a cup with cool water. Use a clean spoon to take a scoop of the starter (be careful not to stir the starter and deflate the air bubbles that make it float) and carefully plop it in the water. If it floats, it is gassy and alive and ready to make some bread! If not, don’t despair, it can take a while to get going. Either wait longer if it has only been a few hours since feeding, or if it has been closer to 24 hours since feeding, discard and feed again.After passing the float test, the starter is ready to use for baking! You may find you like to use your starter when it is young, only a few hours after feeding when it just passes the float test. At this point it will smell sweet. If you want a more sour taste, use the starter 6–12 hours after feeding, when it will be more mature and smell a bit more vinegary and funky. This is up to you!Mold: If you see any fuzzy moldy spots on your starter that are black, red, or blue, unless it is very easy to scrape them off the top, unfortunately you need to start over. Sometimes, a while after feeding or being in the refrigerator, the starter will develop a dark, clear liquid on top. This is called hooch and is harmless. Just pour the liquid off!Flour: Use what you have. If you only have all-purpose flour, you can use that. If you only have bread flour, use that. If you only have whole wheat flour, you can use that, just know that you may need to feed more often because it gets funky more quickly.Discard: It may be tempting not to discard most of your starter every time you feed it because you don’t want to waste, but we discard for a variety of reasons. We are giving the starter a lot of fresh food and water to eat. If we don’t discard, the starter will retain a lot of that funkiness and also eventually grow to be huge if you just keep adding water and flour to it. I like to discard into another container and keep that container in the refrigerator until I need it for other baking projects. You can fold the discard into banana bread, pancakes, cookies, etc.Storage: Once your starter is up and running, you can either keep it at room temperature and feed it daily, or store it in the refrigerator. To store in the refrigerator, do a regular discard and feed, then place in the refrigerator. A day before you want to begin making bread, pull the starter out and let it come to room temperature. Then, discard and feed as usual.Scaling: This starter recipe calls for equal amounts of water and total flour by weight. You can scale this recipe up or down as needed, depending on how much starter the recipe you are going to make calls for."

Let sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast has bloomed.NOTE: It may be tempting to use all whole wheat flour in this recipe, but, in our testing, that method resulted in dense, tough, squat breads that barely rose when we tried to proof them.  Using some all-purpose flour was necessary to give us the rise and soft, pillowy texture we wanted in a good sandwich bread.Pour in the wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oil, and salt, and mix until the dough comes together in a ball that does not stick to your fingers.NOTE: You can also do the first 2 steps in a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mixing on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the sides.On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it really starts to form a tight ball.Form the dough into a ball shape and transfer to a greased bowl, turning the dough to coat it in grease. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a wet towel and store in a warm place for 1 hour.Allow the dough to proof until it has doubled in size. Save the plastic wrap or towel as you’ll be using it again.Transfer the proofed dough to a lightly floured surface and press the dough – don’t stretch – into a 7x7-inch (18x18 cm) square.Fold the top 3rd of the square down, and the bottom 3rd up to form an even rectangle. Pinch the top fold to seal the dough.Roll the dough over so that the seal faces upward and fold both ends up toward the center, so that the dough has formed an even log shape about the size of your loaf pan.Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and cover with with the same plastic wrap or towel used before.Let the dough rise for 1 hour, until it has poofed over the edge of the loaf pan about 1½ inches (4 cm).Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).Remove the plastic wrap or towel and transfer to the oven and bake for 50-55 minutes, until the dough has browned slightly and formed a light brown crust.Immediately remove the loaf from the pan and set aside to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing.Store in an airtight container or bag. The bread can be stored in freezer up to 6 months."

Working one spice group at a time, toast the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mace blades (if using), fenugreek seeds, black and green cardamom pods, black peppercorns, and cloves in the warm skillet until each spice is fragrant and lightly browned, a few minutes per spice. Transfer the toasted spices to a plate or small tray while you toast the remaining spices. Let cool to room temperature.Set a mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Once all of the whole spices have cooled, transfer to a high-powered blender or spice grinder (working in batches, if needed) and grind the spices into a fine powder. Pour the ground spices into the strainer and sift into the bowl below. Return any larger pieces to the blender and re-grind and sift into the bowl.Add the Kashmiri chile powder, ground ginger, garlic powder, and nutmeg to the bowl with the ground spices and mix well to combine (if using ground mace, add here). Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place until ready to use. The spice mixture will keep for up to 2 weeks.Make the yogurt marinade: In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ¾ cup of the tandoori spice blend, the lemon juice, salt, ginger, and garlic until smooth.Remove the innards from the turkey and discard (or save for another use). Pat the turkey dry all over with paper towels. Place the turkey in a bowl large enough to fit the bird, then pour the yogurt marinade all over the turkey. Use your fingers to gently loosen the turkey skin, starting from the top of the cavity and working your way toward the breasts and down toward the legs, being careful not to tear the skin. Use your hands to work the marinade underneath the skin and all over the entire bird. Once well-coated, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.While the turkey is marinating, make the tandoori ghee: Add the ghee to a small saucepan and cook over medium heat for 2–3 minutes, until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the tandoori spice blend (it should sizzle lightly once it touches the ghee), then stir to incorporate and remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the salt. Transfer ¼ cup of the ghee to a small bowl and set aside to use for the gravy. Carefully pour the remaining 1¼ cups of ghee into a heat-proof container.After marinating, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 2–3 hours before cooking.Arrange a rack in the lower-middle section of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Set a V-shaped rack inside a roasting pan.Once ready to cook, remove the turkey from the yogurt marinade and wipe off as much as possible. Squeeze out as much marinade as possible from underneath the turkey skin as well.Grab the turkey by the legs and carefully transfer to the prepared roasting pan with the breast side up. With your hands, rub about a third of the tandoori ghee over the bird, then rub another third underneath the skin. Reserve the remaining ghee for basting the turkey.Stuff the cavity with the lemons, garlic, ginger, and cilantro. Tuck the wings underneath the turkey, then tie the legs together with kitchen twine, wrapping around the bird to secure. Pour 3 cups of chicken stock into the bottom of the roasting pan.Roast the turkey for 30 minutes, rotating halfway, until the skin is mostly golden brown. While the turkey roasts, melt the remaining third of tandoori ghee in a small saucepan over low heat, or in a small bowl in the microwave.After roasting for 30 minutes, baste the turkey with the melted ghee. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). If the bottom of the pan looks dry, pour in 1–2 more cups of stock. Continue roasting, basting and rotating the turkey every 30 minutes, until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the leg reaches 165°F (75°C), 120–150 minutes more. The skin should be shiny, crisp, and golden brown–if the skin begins to get too dark, lightly tend the bird with aluminum foil. Remove the turkey from the oven and baste once more. Let rest for 30–60 minutes. Reserve the drippings, discarding the fat, for making the gravy.Make the tandoori gravy: Add the reserved ¼ cup tandoori ghee to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, whisking frequently, for 3–5 minutes, until the roux is darker in color and smells fragrant and toasted. Add 1 tablespoon of the tandoori spice blend and whisk to combine, letting toast for another minute, until fragrant. Gradually whisk in the turkey drippings (adding chicken stock as needed for a total of 3 cups). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 10–15 minutes, until thickened slightly. Remove the gravy from heat.To serve, set the whole turkey in the center of a large platter for a classic presentation, or carve the bird and arrange the cut pieces on the platter and garnish with cilantro and quartered limes. Serve immediately with the hot gravy alongside, as well as any traditional tandoori sides of choice."

Roll the dough between the two sheets of parchment to ¼-inch (½ cm) thickness.Using a small round cookie cutter (alternatively, we found the rim of a champagne glass to be a perfect size!) cut the dough into individual rounds and place on a large parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving at least ½-inch (1¼ cm) between each cookie.Pack together and re-roll out any scraps to cut additional cookies.

Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 8–10 minutes, until the syrup starts to thicken slightly. (To test if the syrup has the right consistency, dip a spoon into the syrup and, after letting it cool slightly, place a droplet of the syrup between your thumb and forefinger. Pull your fingers apart very slightly; if the syrup is ready, there should be a single strand that stretches between the fingers. If not, continue cooking, checking every minute or 2, until the syrup is ready.)Once the syrup reaches the right consistency, stir in the saffron threads, McCormick® cardamom, and lemon juice, then remove the pot from heat and cover to keep warm until ready to use. The syrup should be very warm when using; if it cools down and over-thickens, sprinkle in a small amount of water and heat over low heat until warmed again.Make the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, corn flour, baking soda, and McCormick® turmeric. Add the yogurt, water, and lemon juice, and whisk in one direction for 4 minutes, until very smooth with a texture close to pancake batter — thick but pourable. Add more water or flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to reach the desired consistency.Heat the vegetable oil and ghee together in a medium heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350–360°F(180°C). The oil level should be 2½–3 inches deep; add more vegetable oil if needed.Set a wire rack over paper towels.When ready to fry, test the oil temperature by transferring 2 tablespoons of batter to a squeeze bottle and squeezing into the hot oil in a spiral pattern. The batter should start bubbling and rise to the surface immediately, without browning. If the jalebi appears thin and stringy, the batter is too thin. If it browns immediately, the oil is too hot. The batter should puff slightly and brown over the course of 1–2 minutes. Adjust the oil temperature and batter as needed, then transfer the rest of the batter to the squeeze bottle.Make the jalebi: Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, squeeze 3 to 4 tablespoons of the batter at a time into the hot oil in spiral shapes, starting from the center and going outward to 3–4 inches in diameter. Cook for 45–60 seconds per side, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside and cooked through and soft on the inside. Gently remove the jalebi from the hot oil with a slotted spoon, letting the excess oil drip off, then immediately dunk in the warm sugar syrup. Let soak for 1 minute on each side, then transfer to the wire rack and let rest for 2 minutes, or until ready to serve.Serve the jalebi warm."

Transfer to the refrigerator to steep for at least 2 hours, up to overnightWhile the cream steeps, macerate the strawberries: Use a small paring knife to stem and hull the strawberries, then halve or quarter lengthwise.

The dough will still look a little dry.Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and use a bench scraper to help press into a rough rectangle. Use a rolling pin to gently roll the dough into a roughly 8 x 10-inch rectangle. Fold the dough crosswise in thirds, like a letter, then turn the dough 90° and roll out again to a rectangle. Repeat folding and rolling for a total of 4 or 5 folds.Carefully transfer the dough onto the prepared baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes (this will help the dough hydrate and bake evenly).Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).Transfer the dough rectangle to a cutting board. Use a large chef’s knife to trim the edges to make clean sides, reserving the scraps for another use. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise and in thirds crosswise for 6 square biscuits. Place the biscuits back on the baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Brush the top of each biscuit with the heavy cream and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar.Bake the biscuits until risen and golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately brush the top of each biscuit with the honey. (Microwave the honey for 10 seconds for easier brushing, if needed).Make the chantilly cream: Place a fine-mesh strainer over a tall, narrow container. Pour the steeped cream through the strainer into the container and discard the tea leaves.Add the powdered sugar to the strained cream. Blend with a stick blender until stiff peaks form, about 30 seconds.When ready to assemble, split the biscuits in half. Place a bottom half on a plate and spoon the chantilly cream over top. Spoon a generous amount of strawberries and syrup over the cream and finish with the top of the biscuit.Enjoy!RECIPE BY: Codii LopezChef’s Note: The biscuits are best eaten the same day they are baked. If you don’t think you will consume them all in one day, you can cut the dough and bake as many as you’d like, then wrap the remaining unbaked biscuits tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month. Unbaked biscuit dough should be stored in the freezer; storing in the refrigerator may cause the dough to oxidize and discolor."

Sift in the powdered sugar and salt and mix until the frosting is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes.Frost the cakes: Scoop 1 cup of buttercream onto 1 chocolate cake round and spread evenly across the top. Place the second cake round on top, pressing down gently to secure. Spread another cup buttercream evenly over the top and sides to create a crumb coat. Cover and set the remaining buttercream aside until ready to decorate. Refrigerate the cake until ready to decorate.Make the meringue mushrooms: Preheat the oven to 225°F (105°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.Add the egg whites to a heat-safe bowl. Using a hand mixer, whip on medium speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and cream of tartar and beat just to incorporate.Add the sugar and water to a saute pan and stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium-high heat and cook without stirring until the syrup creates bubbles that are the size of quarters and the temperature reaches 248°F (120°C).With the hand mixer running on medium speed, carefully pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg white mixture, resting the pan on the edge of the bowl and aiming the syrup to hit the side of the bowl so it does not splash against the beaters. Whip the mixture until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat on medium-low speed until just combined. Transfer the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch (1.24 cm) round tip.To make the mushroom caps, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the meringue firmly onto half of the prepared baking sheet into disc shapes ranging from ½ inch (1.24 cm) to 1½ (3.81 cm) inches in diameter, leaving at least ½ inch (1.24 cm) of space between each cap. You should use about ⅔ of the meringue. Dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each cap. Your fingers will create natural dimples and watermarks to mimic the look of mushrooms caps.To make the mushroom stems, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the remaining meringue firmly onto the other half of the baking sheet in ½-inch and 1-inch long pieces, leaving at least ½ inch of space between each stem. The number of stems should match the number of caps.Bake the meringue mushrooms for about 3 hours, until the caps and stems feel dry to the touch and are light beige in color. Remove from the oven and let the meringues cool completely.Lightly dust the mushroom caps with the cocoa powder, then use a pastry brush to brush the cocoa powder into the caps until they are a rustic brown color.Spread a bit of melted dark chocolate on the bottom of a mushroom cap, then press the cap onto the top of a stem. Repeat to assemble the remaining mushrooms, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to set completely, about 10 minutes.Make the chocolate bark: Add the heavy cream to a small stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.Add the chocolate chips to a medium heatproof bowl. Pour the warm cream over the chocolate and stir until melted completely. Let the ganache cool to room temperature, about 1 hour; it should be thick and have the texture of frosting. Once cool, add ⅓ of the ganache to a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch round tip and the remaining ganache to a piping bag fitted with a 1-inch round tip.Make the edible moss:  Pulse the pistachios and matcha powder in a food processor until coarsely ground, being careful not to process into a paste. Set aside until ready to decorate.Make the buttercream flowers: Divide the buttercream frosting evenly between 5 medium bowls. Add the violet, pink, yellow, avocado, and mauve food coloring to each bowl and stir until well combined. Transfer each color frosting to a separate piping bag fitted with tips to pipe flowers and leaves. Set aside until ready to decorate.Assemble the cake: Spread the remaining dulce de leche buttercream over the top of the cake. Using the bag with the ½-inch tip, pipe the ganache in a swirl on top of the cake, starting from the center and working toward the outer edge. Use a fork to swirl the ganache and buttercream together to make the top of the tree stump.Using the bag with the 1-inch tip, pipe the remaining ganache onto the sides of the cake and spread to coat completely. Use a fork to draw lines vertically up the sides of the cake for the tree bark.Place mounds of edible moss on top of and around the cake, then place the mushrooms around the moss.Use the colored frostings to pipe leaves and flowers around the cake."

Roll out 1 part into a long rope, about 1 inch wide, cutting in half and working with 1 half at a time if the rope is becoming too long.

Place another cake layer cut-side down on top of the first layer, spreading another even layer of frosting on top. Repeat with the remaining 2 layers. Spread a thin layer of frosting all over the sides and smooth out with an offset spatula or bench scraper. Refrigerate for 20-30 minutes, until the layer of frosting has hardened.Frost the outside of the cake with a thick layer of frosting. Crumble the reserved cake scraps, then press into the frosting around the bottom of the cake.Slice and serve.Enjoy!RECIPE BY: Amanda Berrill"

Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet.Spread ½ cup (110 G) of the garlic goat cheese over the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch (50 cm) border around the edges. Arrange half of the potatoes, slightly overlapping, over the goat cheese, then top with half of the Swiss chard and onion mixture. Repeat with remaining potatoes and chard mixture.Fold the edges of the crust up and over the filling to create a rustic look. Brush the crust with the beaten egg.

Stir with a rubber spatula to dissolve the starter.Add the bread flour and whole wheat flour. Use a spatula or your clean hands to mix until combined and there are no dry spots. Cover with a clean cotton kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 60 minutes.Bulk fermentation: After resting the dough, add the salt and remaining 10 grams water. Use your hands to incorporate the salt, squishing the dough through your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed.Set a bowl of water nearby. Once the salt is incorporated, dip your hand in the water to prevent sticking. Use your wet hand to stretch the dough from the edge of the bowl upwards, then fold toward the center. Repeat a total of 8 times, rotating the bowl slightly after each fold.After the folds, carefully lift the dough up, flip it over, place it back in the bowl and tuck the edges under the dough. Scrape down the edges of the bowl, then cover with the kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place for 60 minutes.Repeat the stretching and folding process 2 more times, waiting 60 minutes after each folding session before beginning again. You should see signs of fermentation in the form of an increase in volume and bubbles along the edges and top of the dough. Wait a little longer, up to 30 more minutes between folds, if you don’t see those signs yet.Preshape: An hour after the final stretch and fold, dip your hands in the water. Think of the dough as the face of a clock. Slide your hands into the bowl at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock. Partially lift the dough from the bowl and let it fold under itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat the lifting and fold under 5-6 times, until dough has begun to come together in a ball.Carefully lift the dough onto a clean surface. Lightly sprinkle the dough with the dusting flour. Using a bench scraper, or lightly floured hands, carefully rotate and drag the dough towards yourself along the surface, building tension until you have a round, taut ball of dough. Do not make the ball too tight, as it may tear. Lightly flour the dough, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30–40 minutes.Final shape: Dust a proofing basket or a medium bowl lined with a cotton towel lightly with flour.After 40 minutes, the dough should look relaxed and have spread out slightly. Lightly flour the top of the dough again. Using the bench scraper, or a silicone spatula and lightly floured hands, carefully flip the dough over, so the unfloured part is facing upwards.Think of the clock again. Fold in 12 o’clock towards the center, then 6 o’clock, 3 o’clock, and 9 o’clock, then each of the remaining 4 diagonal corners. Carefully transfer the dough, seam-side up, to the prepared proofing basket or bowl. Pinch the seams to ensure they are sealed. Cover the bowl with the towel.Final proof: Transfer the dough to the refrigerator to finish proofing overnight, 12–18 hours. If you want to bake the same day, leave at room temperature for 2–3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator while you preheat the oven. (Overnight proofing is highly recommended!)When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Place a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker in the oven while it preheats. Make sure your oven has come up to temperature before baking, at least 30 minutes.Prepare a piece of parchment paper about the size of the bottom of your baking vessel. Place the parchment over the proofing basket and gently flip the basket over so the dough drops onto the parchment.Carefully remove the baking vessel from the oven. Use the parchment paper to carefully lift the dough into the pan. Use a sharp paring knife or bread lame to slash the top of the dough a few times. This scoring will allow steam to escape. Cover the vessel with the lid and carefully place in the oven.Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C). Continue baking for another 15–20 minutes, until the crust is amber brown.Remove the bread from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack. Check to make sure it is done baking by tapping on the bottom--you should hear a hollow sound. Though it may be tempting to dive right in, let the bread cool completely, at least 2 hours, before slicing with a serrated knife.Store the loaf cut-side down on a cutting board, or in a plastic bag. You can freeze the whole loaf, or pre-slice, then freeze and pull out slices as needed.Notes: If you are using all-purpose flour, use 375 grams of water instead of 400 grams of water for the initial mix. If you don’t have a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker, you could bake in a cast iron skillet, a pizza stone or a sheet pan, uncovered. You could also bake the bread in a greased 9 x 5-inch (22 x 12 cm) loaf pan (place the bread in the pan seam-side down instead of in a proofing basket.) Bake at 475°F (240°C) for 40–45 minutes, until amber brown. Reduce the oven temperature for the last 20 minutes of baking if the bread is getting too dark on top. The bread won’t look as shiny and have as crispy of a crust, but will taste just as good!"

Bake for 10 minutes, or until the excess moisture has released and the beans begin to crack down the middle. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Prepare the duxelle (mushroom mixture): In a large pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Once the butter begins to foam, add the shallot, mushrooms, thyme, and salt. Stir to combine and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid evaporates from the mushrooms and they begin to turn golden brown. Transfer the duxelle to a bowl and set aside to cool.Return the pan to the stove (no need to clean), and heat a drizzle of oil over medium heat. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and the frozen spinach. Break the spinach up with a wooden spoon and sauté for 2 minutes, or until the garlic is toasted and the spinach is warmed through. Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.Return the same pan back to the stove over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion, carrot, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and beginning to turn golden brown. Add the remaining 2 cloves of garlic and the sage and sauté for 1 minute more, or until the garlic is just fragrant. Add the balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and bread. Stir until the bread is well-coated, then remove from the heat and let cool slightly.Transfer the bread mixture to a food processor. Add in the roasted kidney beans and chestnuts and vegetable stock. Pulse a few times, until just combined. (The mixture should be an even consistency but still have texture to it. It should stick together when pressed in your palm). Transfer the bread mixture to a large bowl. Gently stir in the roasted butternut squash and season with more salt and pepper to taste.Increase the oven temperature to 425°F (220°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece of puff pastry into rectangle slightly smaller than the prepared baking sheet. Transfer 1 piece of the pastry to the baking sheet and set the other piece aside.Assemble the Wellington: Spread the cooled duxelle lengthwise down the middle of the puff pastry on the baking sheet, creating a rectangle the size that you want your wellington to be. Make sure to leave about a 2-inch border at both ends of the pastry. (You will be removing all excess dough and using it for decorations.)Next, arrange half of the bell peppers over the duxelle. Make sure they lay flat, only overlap on the edges, and completely cover the mushrooms.Top the bell pepper layer with the roasted squash and bread mixture by using your hands to pack the mixture into a loaf, making sure it doesn’t go over the edges of the peppers.Layer the remaining roasted peppers evenly over the bread mixture.Top the peppers with the spinach mixture. (This will be a bit messy, but it’s okay, it’s part of the process!)Gently roll the second piece of pastry over the spinach layer, creating a blanket over all of the vegetable layers. Press the pastry gently around the filling to create a log shape. Trim the pastry so that there is about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) border around the log.Fold the bottom layer of the pastry over the top layer and seal the dough together with a decorative crimp. Cut decorative shapes from the dough scraps and arrange over the log. Using a paring knife, cut a few vents into your wellington to allow steam to escape. You can hide the vents along the edges of your decorations.Generously brush the top and sides of the wellington with the beaten egg.Bake for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving."
